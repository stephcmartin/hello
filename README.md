# Web Developer | Community Builder | Driven By The Details

Education enthusiast and community builder turned full stack web developer with an eye for design.

Born and raised in the vibrant city of Hong Kong, I have a comprehensive background in digital education, professional development and building tech communities. My prior roles at General Assembly, WeWork and Accelerate solidified my passion for empowering individuals to pursue the work that they love. 

I am the person that sees helping others as their purpose in life and always want to get to the heart of the issue so that people need not be rescued at all.
